I have resolved the `AnnotationException` by removing the redundant `@Table` annotation from the `B2BPartner`, `B2CPartner`, and `SupplierPartner` subclasses. The root entity, `Partner`, correctly defines the `SINGLE_TABLE` inheritance strategy with the `@Table`, `@Inheritance`, and `@DiscriminatorColumn` annotations. This ensures that the JPA entity hierarchy is correctly configured, and the application should now start without this error. I recommend you try running the application again.
